          APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set
          applies to. The format is "group/version" just like the top-level
          APIVersion field. It is necessary to track the version of a field
          set because it cannot be automatically converted.

      subresource:
        description: |-
          Subresource is the name of the subresource used to update that object, or
          empty string if the object was updated through the main resource. The
          value of this field is used to distinguish between managers, even if they
          share the same name. For example, a status update will be distinct from a
          regular update using the same manager name.
          Note that the APIVersion field is not related to the Subresource field and
          it always corresponds to the version of the main resource.
        type: string
      time:

          Time is the timestamp of when the ManagedFields entry was added. The
          timestamp will also be updated if a field is added, the manager
          changes any of the owned fields value or removes a field. The
          timestamp does not update when a field is removed from the entry
          because another manager took it over.

      deletionTimestamp:
        description: |-
          DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
          field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
          directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
          from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
          finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
          Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
          future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
          For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
          by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
          the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
          remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
          exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
          resource is fully terminated.
          If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

          Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested.
          Read-only.

      finalizers:
        description: |-
          Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry
          is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry
          from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries
          in this list can only be removed.
          Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
          because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
          finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
          If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
          in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
          waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
          component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
          Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
          are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

          If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different
          than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix.
          The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field,
          and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value
